  <p id="header"> E. Marmol Short Biography <p>
    <br/>
  <p>My name is Erika Marmol, and I'm a current Junior studying Computer Engineering at Tufts University. I’m passionate about web development, and have pursued this passion with my past internships. I’ve worked with two different companies to improve their websites both on the front end and functionality wise. Past internship experiences have helped me gain real-world work experience that has aided my growth intellectually as well as professionally. My past internships have mainly focused on web-development, which I would like to expand my knowledge on. I would also like to branch out and gain more experience in different areas of programming.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>Past projects that are relevant to my experience include: working with a partner to create a maze game in re-locatable assembly in the HCS-12 platform. I have designed a pulse oximeter in SPICE, and implemented the design, which filtered out a 60 Hz power grid. I have also worked on a project with a team of four to design and build a 4-bit countdown timer with an LED display and audio alarm.

  <br/>
  <p> Outside of my major, and couse work I’m extremely dedicated to volunteering - I teach English every week for 2 hours in Massachusetts. I'm also the President and Treasurer of the Nu Chapter of Latinas Promoviendo Comunidad / Lambda Pi Chi Sorority, Inc. where I further do community service, as well as help coordinate events centered around discussions on Afro-Latinidad and being a Latina at Tufts.</p>
